# VBS
You get 3 minutes to upload your feedback to me!

Press "Code" and "Download ZIP" to receive my VBS Code, upon opening the code, your default web browser will be opened to an online text editor, use the text editor to create your feedback to me, after around 3 minuites a new window in your default browser will open sending you to my anonymous drive upload site where you can upload a .txt file with your feedback!

(Do note that it will ask for a name and email, it doesn't email you or anything. I don't see the information it's just collected in case something malicious is uploaded through their service)
